It appears IBackgroundCopyManager_CreateJob points to a generic COM method
rather than an implementation-specific one. Due to this a potential way
forward would be to keep a track of X IBackgroundCopyManager this pointers.
The QueryInterface approach (for determining whether an object implements
IID_BackgroundCopyManager didn't seem to work so far).
